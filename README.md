WP-Cicero-Letters
=================

Plugin that incorporates the Azavea Cicero api to get officials and send them letters. Options are including sending a already filled out letter or write your own.

Also it has the option to have a branded page or a blank page with the form.

This will likely need some tweaking before its ready for use again.
